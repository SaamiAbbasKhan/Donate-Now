## üöÄ Core Features

*   **Curated Directory:** Browse a list of humanitarian organizations.
*   **(Conceptual) Verification:** Organizations are intended to be vetted based on transparency and impact (currently illustrative, marked with verification status and date).
*   **Direct Links:** Provides direct website links for users to visit and donate via the organizations' official platforms. **DonateNow** does not handle payments.
*   **Search Functionality:** Search organizations by name, focus keyword, or region.
*   **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter the list by specific Categories (e.g., Medical Aid, Children) and Regions (e.g., Global, Africa, Palestine). Multiple filters can be applied.
*   **Sorting Options:** Sort organizations alphabetically (A-Z, Z-A), by recently verified date, or show favorites first.
*   **Favorites System:** Mark organizations as favorites using a simple heart icon. Favorites are saved locally in the user's browser via `localStorage`.
*   **Responsive Design:** Aims for usability across different screen sizes.
*   **Static Site:** Built entirely with frontend technologies, making it fast and easy to host.

## üîß Tech Stack

*   **HTML5:** Semantic structure for content.
*   **CSS3:** Basic styling and custom rules (in `css/style.css`).
*   **Tailwind CSS (v3 via CDN):** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all dynamic functionality including:
    *   DOM manipulation
    *   Filtering, searching, and sorting logic
    *   Event handling
    *   Managing favorites using `localStorage`
    *   Loading data from `data/organizations.js`

## üå± Future Development

**DonateNow** is currently a conceptual demonstration. Future enhancements could include:

*   **Implementing a Robust Verification System:** Moving beyond the conceptual stage to a reliable method for vetting organizations.
*   **Backend Integration:** Introducing a backend (e.g., using serverless functions or a simple API) to:
    *   Manage organization data more effectively (e.g., in a database).
    *   Allow for easier updates without changing frontend code.
    *   Potentially implement user accounts (if desired for features like persistent favorites across devices).
*   **Expanding the Directory:** Adding significantly more verified organizations.
*   **Refined UI/UX:** Further improvements to user interface elements and overall user experience based on feedback.
*   **Accessibility Audit:** Ensuring the site meets high accessibility standards (WCAG).
*   **Localization/i18n:** Adding support for multiple languages.
